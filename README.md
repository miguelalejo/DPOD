# [Dense Pose Object Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11020)

This repo is a recreation of the methodology for 6D pose estimation by  DPOD: 6D Pose Object Detector and Refiner ,written by Sergey Zakharov, Ivan Shugurov, Slobodan Ilic [[1]](#references).
Given a RGB image, the goal is to estimate the 6D pose of an object.
Model was trained and tested entirely on the Linemod dataset [[2]](#references). For every 99 out of 100 images, MSCoco dataset [[3]](#references) was used to change the background of the input image for the correspondence block to prevent overfitting.

## Installation and Training steps

```
$ git clone https://github.com/miguelalejo/DPOD.git
$ cd DPOD
$ chmod +x dataset_install.sh
$ ./dataset_install.sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python train.py
$ python eval.py

```

## Overview of the code

Below is a brief description of the .py files:
1. create_ground_truth.py - create the grund truth ID, U and V masks and the changed background image.
2. correspondence_block.py - trainining loop for the correspondence block base on the Unet encoder decoder architecture
3. pose_block.py - use PnP and RANSAC for initial pose estimation
4. create_renderings.py - create input for DL based pose refiner
5. pose_refinement.py - training loop for DL based pose refiner
6. train.py - trainining script for all of the above
7. eval.py - evaluation script for all of the above

## Future Work

- [ ] Add additional in-plane rotations to artificially simulate new poses while training
- [ ] Add resnet18 as the encoder decoder architecture as described in section A.1
- [ ] Train and evaluate the model on Occlusion Dataset and with synthetic data
